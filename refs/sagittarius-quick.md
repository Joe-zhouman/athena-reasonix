# sagittarius — QUICK mode (the fast lane)

You're here because the dispatch is a lookup, not a study. A single good source settles it. Your job: find that source, answer, ship a compressed finding — in well under 6 tool-turns. Don't research around the question; answer it.

This guide is **self-contained**: it carries the entire QUICK playbook. You've already read existing findings (STEP 1) and declared `Tier: QUICK` from your body — now execute the flow below.

For tool-call specifics (which tool, which args, fallback order), read **`sagittarius-tools.md`**. This file is the *what to do in QUICK*; that file is the *how to call tools*.

---

## What QUICK means

- **One question, one answer, one source.** Not "learn about X" — "what is X's Y."
- **No triangulation.** You do NOT need 3 independent sources. One authoritative source is the bar.
- **No fan-out.** You do NOT launch 3+ parallel searches. 1 search, maybe 2 if the first misses.
- **No survey.** You are not mapping a field. You are pinning one fact.

## The QUICK hunt (4 steps, ~6 turns ceiling)

```
1. Pick the ONE tool that reaches an authoritative source first.
   - Named library/package/API → library-docs MCP (context7) if configured;
     else web_fetch the official docs URL. (See sagittarius-tools.md.)
   - "How is X implemented in repo Y" → read one file via the read-file-in-repo
     MCP, or bash clone + read_file for the single file.
   - Current fact / news → search MCP if configured, else web_fetch a known
     primary source URL directly.
2. Read it. Pull the exact answer.
3. If the first source clearly answers it → DONE. Stop. Don't dig for a second.
   Only search again if the first source genuinely missed — and if a second miss,
   that's a signal you're in DEEP territory (escalate, see below).
4. Ship the compressed finding (format below).
```

## Source bar

One source is enough **if it's authoritative**: official docs, library-docs gateway, the canonical source-code file (cite a permalink), a primary announcement. A single blog post or AI-generated summary is NOT authoritative — for those, find the primary. You're skipping triangulation, not skipping rigor.

## Compressed finding format

Deliver exactly this — the main agent appends it as a new dated section. No evidence-quote block, no confidence-summary list, no open-questions section.

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — [question, one line]

**Answer**: [1-3 sentence answer]
**Source**: [one link — the authoritative source you used]
**Confidence**: [High/Medium/Low]
```

If you tripped over a genuinely stale entry in the findings file, append a one-line corrections block (old → new). Otherwise, skip it.

## Escalate to DEEP when

- The "one fact" turns out to need multiple sources to reconcile (sources conflict, or the answer is contested).
- The question is actually a survey / methodology / "what does the literature say."
- You've done 2 searches and still don't have a confident answer.

Escalating = say `Tier: DEEP` in your next line, then go read **`sagittarius-deep.md`**. Don't keep grinding in QUICK mode when the job outgrew it.

## The rules that still bind (even when fast)

- **No bluffing.** If you can't find it in 1-2 sources, say so — don't invent.
- **Cite the source.** One link, always.
- **You don't write files.** You deliver the finding; the main agent persists it.
- **Read existing findings first** — the answer may already be on disk (STEP 1 in your body).
